Define probability distributions and their key properties\n2. Apply the normal distribution to calculate probabilities\n3. Standardise variables using the normal distribution\n4. Differentiate between population, sample and sampling distributions\n5. Explain the difference between standard deviation and standard error\n6. Apply the central limit theorem and understand its significance\n7. Use R to implement these statistical concepts\n\n## Quick checklist\n\n- [ ] Create and edit Quarto documents\n- [ ] Understand the concept of central tendency and spread/dispersion\n- [ ] Interpret skewness (and kurtosis) in a distribution of data\n- [ ] Know that different data types require different approaches to summarising data\n- [ ] Generate some plots in `ggplot2`\n\n# Probability distributions\n\n## Example: rainfall {.scrollable}\n\nConsider measuring daily rainfall amounts in a coastal wetland. *Some* days have no rain. **Most** days have small to moderate amounts. *Few* days have very heavy rainfall.\n\n::: {.fragment}\nThis creates a pattern of variation in rainfall amounts, which at some point we can predict.

It allows us to make inferences about populations using samples\n   - We can estimate population parameters with known precision\n   - We can construct confidence intervals\n\n2. It works for any population distribution\n   - Even when data is not normally distributed (like our rainfall)\n   - Enables parametric tests for non-normal data (with sufficient sample size)\n\n3. It explains why the normal distribution is so important\n   - Many natural phenomena represent averages of many small effects\n   - This is why we see normal distributions so often in nature\n\n# Thanks!\n\nThis presentation is based on the [SOLES Quarto reveal.js template](https://github.com/usyd-soles-edu/soles-revealjs) and is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License][cc-by].\n\n\n<!-- Links -->\n[cc-by]: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n",
