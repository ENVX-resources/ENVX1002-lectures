I am currently lecturing on the land of the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation and pay my respects to their Elders, past, present and emerging. \n\n\n# Emergency procedures\n\n- In the unlikely event of an **emergency**, we may need to evacuate the building.\n- If we need to **evacuate**, we will ask you to take your belongings and follow the green exit signs.\n- We will move a safe distance from the building and maintain physical distancing whilst waiting until the emergency is over. \n- In some circumstances, we might be asked to remain inside the building for our own safety. We call this a **lockdown** or **shelter-in-place**. More information is available at www.sydney.edu.au/emergency.\n\n\n\n\n# Health and safety advice\n\n![](images/health-advice.png)\n\n\n\n\n# Illness & absence\n\n- If you become ill during the semester, or need to stay at home or need to be absent for a period, please notify your unit of study coordinator.\n- If illness impacts assessment, use the usual mechanisms including [simple extensions](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/simple-extensions.html) and [special consideration](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/special-consideration.html) to arrange reasonable adjustments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Student support\n\n- Visit the [Student life, wellbeing and support](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/support.html) webpage to find out about the student services, resources and events available to support you while you study:\n  - Health and wellbeing\n  - Academic Support \n  - Personal support \n  - Getting connected\n- Questions about getting started this semester?

Continuing students can self-enrol at any time.\n\n![](images/integrity.png)\n\n\n\n\n# What is academic dishonesty?\n\nThe following are some behaviours that are academically dishonest:\n\n- **Plagiarism** (this is the most common form)\n- **Collusion** or illegitimate co-operation\n- **Recycling** (using your own work from previous assessments)\n- **Cheating**, including **contract** cheating\n  - sharing questions or accessing solutions on online \"help sites\"\t\n  - receiving coaching from a private tutoring company on how to complete an assignment\n  - asking someone else to write your assignment (for payment or not) \n- **Exam cheating** (using prohibited materials, working with others)\n- **Fabrication** or falsification of sources, data or results\n\n \n\n\n# What are the consequences?\n\n- The University has strong mechanisms for detection of potential academic dishonesty.\n- Suspected breaches are reported to the faculty educational integrity team for investigation.\n- The University is deeply committed to ensuring the integrity of its educational programs and treats integrity breaches seriously. As a result, the academic consequences for cheating are numerous.\n- You may:\n  - need to resubmit a task with a mark penalty or\n  - receive a 0 for the assessment or even the unit of study\n  - be suspended or even excluded from your studies for serious misconduct\n\n\n\n\n# Understanding contract cheating\n\nCommercial cheating services are **ILLEGAL** in Australia. Illegal cheating services offer to:\n\n- Sell you essays, assignments, study notes or exams\n- Ask you to upload previous work from your course\n- Sit exams on your behalf\n\nIf you use cheating services, you can face disciplinary action in accordance with USYD’s policies. Resulting action can include:\n\n- Failing the unit of study or course\n- Suspension or exclusion from your studies\n- Losing your professional accreditation\n- Being blackmailed by cheating service operators\n- For international students, losing your visa\n\n\n\n\n# Be aware of illegitimate services\n\n- Be aware of any services that are not affiliated with the University.\n- In the online environment, malicious organisations masquerading as \"online help sites and platforms\" are preying on students. \n  - These organisations may pressure you to pay for online assistance, then turn to blackmail when you change your mind.\n  - Essays or solutions bought from the internet are usually poor quality, badly written and often wrong. \n  - You won’t acquire the skills and knowledge required for your degree, making it difficult to complete further assessments.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nAs a student, you can contact the [Office of Educational Integrity](educational.integrity@sydney.edu.au) to report something anonymously or seek advice.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Sitting proctored tests\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n- Exams and mid semester test will be face-to-face unless we experience circumstances that prohibit this.\n- ProctorU software is used to monitor your conduct during an exam.\nIncidents are flagged to the University and reviewed for breaches of academic integrity. \n- The exam will be compromised if you: \n  - Use prohibited materials (e.g., headphones, mobile phones, etc)\n  - Communicate or collude with others\n  - Seek help via a third party, the university’s sites or help sites\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n**To ensure success, we recommend the following tips:**\n\n1. Sit directly in front of the camera\n2. Review the online test support site on Canvas \n3. Know what materials are permitted during the exam. \n4. Have your ID ready\n5.

These observations collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and experiments form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called data.

The observations must be objective, measurable, and reproducible.\n\n- **Question**: Based on the observations, a specific, clear, and concise question is formulated. This question should be answerable through further investigation.\n\n- **Research**: This involves gathering information and existing knowledge about the topic. This step helps in understanding what is already known and what gaps in knowledge exist.\n\n- **Hypothesis**: A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for the observations and question. It is a statement that can be tested through further experiments and analysis. A good hypothesis is clear, specific, and testable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scientific method\n\n- **Experimentation**: Experiments are designed to test the hypothesis. This involves manipulating one or more variables (independent variables) to observe the effect on other variables (dependent variables). Experiments should be controlled, meaning that all other variables are kept constant to ensure that only the variable of interest is affecting the outcome.\n\n- **Data Collection**: Data is collected during the experiments. This data must be objective, measurable, and reproducible. Proper data collection is critical to ensure the validity of the experiment.\n\n- **Analysis**: The data collected from the experiments are analyzed to determine whether they support or refute the hypothesis. Statistical methods are often used in this analysis to determine the significance of the results.\n\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, a conclusion is drawn. If the data supports the hypothesis, it may become a theory. If the data does not support the hypothesis, the hypothesis may be revised or rejected, and new hypotheses may be formulated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scientific method\n\n- **Reporting and Publication**: The findings, along with the methodology, are shared with the scientific community through publications, presentations, or reports. This allows other scientists to review, replicate, and build upon the work.\n\n- **Replication**: Other scientists may attempt to replicate the findings to verify the results. Replication is a key part of the scientific process as it helps to confirm the validity of the findings.\n\n- **Theory Development**: If a hypothesis is repeatedly validated and supported by a significant body of evidence, it may contribute to the development of a scientific theory. A theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is supported by a large body of evidence.\n\n\n\n# Ice blocks?\n\n- Why is an ice cube interesting?\n- How might we apply the scientific method to ice?\n- What might be some criticisms of the scientific method?\n\n![Koya979 - stock.adobe.com](images/iceblocks.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scientific method\n\n- [Gap minder link](https://www.gapminder.org/videos/the-joy-of-stats/)\n- From about 50 minutes on wards is about big data & mechanistic models\n\n\n# References\n\n- Quinn & Keough (2002).
