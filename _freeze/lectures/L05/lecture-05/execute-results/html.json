Examples are in quality control and production processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Tails\n\n- Let say we would like to test whether a sample or population behaves according to a known or expected value. For example, ENVX1002 students have a mean heart rate of 70 beats per minute $(c)$. We could test the relationship between our population or sample mean $(\\mu)$ or $(y)$ and our expected mean $(c)$.\n\n  - $H_0:\\mu=c$ *Two tailed*\n  - $H_1:\\mu \\ne c$ *Two tailed*\n  \n  - $H_0:\\mu \\ge c$ *One tailed - greater than*\n  - $H_1:\\mu < c$ *One tailed - greater than*\n  \n  - $H_0:\\mu \\le c$ *One tailed - less than*\n  - $H_1:\\mu > c$ *One tailed - less than*\n  \n- We usually use the first (two tailed) form unless we are specifically interested in testing whether the difference is in one direction or the means of two variables are equivalent (i.e. equivalence testing in production)\n- In this course we are assuming that the population/sample is normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Type error??\n\n**Type I error**\n\n- False positive: we reject H0  when it is true \n\n**Type II error**\n\n- False negative: we accept H0  when it is false\n\n![](images/error.png)\n\n**Note:** Decreasing the significance level ($\\alpha$) to say 0.01 will increase the probability of type II error\n\n\n\n\n\n# Sample size and power\n\n**Sample size & Power**\n\n- While we won't do these calculations, it is important to think about sample size and power. For example, when comparing two means we can estimate the sample size required using the following \n\n$n = \\left( \\frac{(Z_{\\alpha/2} + Z_{\\beta})^2 \\cdot (SD_1^2 + SD_2^2)}{\\delta^2} \\right)$\n\n- $n$ represents the required sample size for each group.\n- $Z_{\\alpha/2}$ denotes the critical value of the normal distribution at the desired significance level ($\\alpha$). For example, for a 95% confidence level ($\\alpha = 0.05$,$Z_{\\alpha/2}=1.96$.\n- $Z_{\\beta}$ is the Z-score corresponding to the desired power of the test $(1 - \\beta)$. For 80% power $(\\beta=0.2)$, you would use the Z-score that corresponds to 80% in the normal distribution table.\n- $SD_1$ and $SD_2$ are the standard deviations of the two groups being compared.\n- $\\delta$ is the minimum difference in means between the two groups that the study is designed to detect, also known as the effect size.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Sample size and power\n\n**Sample size & Power**\n\nIn a nut shell...\n\n**High Power:** If a test has high power (close to 1), it means that the probability of committing a Type II error is low. This indicates that the test is very likely to detect an effect or difference when one exists.\n\n**Low Power:** Conversely, if a test has low power, the probability of committing a Type II error is high. This means the test is less likely to detect an effect or difference, even if one exists.\n\n**Sample size:** Generally power increases as sample size increases, but so does time and costs!\n\n\n\n\n\n# The t-distribution and degrees of freedom?\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\nThe T-distribution has the following properties:\n\n-\tIt is bell-shaped, symmetrical about the mean, median and mode, which are all of equal value. [It is a little flatter than the normal distribution.]\n\n-\tThe area under the curve = 1, as is the case for all continuous probability distributions.\n\n-\tThe probability density function is defined by three parameters, the mean $\\mu$, the standard deviation $\\sigma$ and the sample size $n$. \n\n-\tThe exact shape of the t distribution depends on the quantity called degrees of freedom, df. The df = n – 1 for any t distribution.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n![Comparing the shapes of the Student’s T and the Z (normal) curve](images/tdist.png)\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Example 1: One sample t-test\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n![Generated using DALL.E 3](images/DALL·E 2024-02-11 10.31.33_hippie.png)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n<span style=\"color: blue;\">**H**</span>ypothesis\n\nSay our hippie friend here has seen the light after a helping of mung beans and wishes to test whether ENVX1002 student average heart rates differ from the global average of 70 bpm (beats per minute). \n\n**State the Null and Alternate hypothesis!**\n\n- $H_0=70 \\text{ bpm}$\t(Null hypothesis)\n\n- $H_1 \\ne 70 \\text{ bpm}$\t(Alternate hypothesis)\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n# Example 1: One sample t-test\n\n<span style=\"color: blue;\">**A**</span>ssumptions\n\n- This time we are testing a data set where the **variance is unknown**.\n- A key assumption for the one-sample t-test is that the sample is \"reasonably\" normally distributed.\n- Why do we need to test the assumption of normality?\n- Think about if our distribution is right skewed, then our *mean* may not reflect the central tendency of our sample population.\n\n\n\n\n# Example 1: One sample t-test\n\n<span style=\"color: blue;\">**A**</span>ssumptions\n\n**Small Samples:** With small samples (typically n < 30), even slight deviations from normality can significantly impact the t-test's validity because the t-test relies heavily on the assumption of normality in this scenario. However, if the data are symmetrically distributed and don't have outliers, the t-test can be robust to mild violations of normality. Note that the t-test adjusts for the sample size, so the larger the sample, the less important the normality assumption becomes.\n\n**Large Samples:** For larger samples (n > 30), the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) suggests that the distribution of the sample means tends to be normal, regardless of the population distribution. This means that for sufficiently large samples, the t-test can be robust to violations of normality. *However, extreme skewness, heavy tails, or outliers can still affect the test's performance*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Example 1: One sample t-test\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n<span style=\"color: blue;\">**A**</span>ssumptions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Assuming 'skewed_sample' is your skewed data.

We can be 95% confident that the true mean heart rate of 63 and 72 (0 d.p.) beats per minute. Our global mean lies within this interval. Therefore we are petty confident that the class average heart rate is similar to the global average.\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Confidence intervals\n\n- A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from a sample, that is likely to contain the value of an unknown population parameter.\n- Confidence are important and many people prefer them to formal hypothesis tests because they give a range of values rather than a single value.\n- There are two types we are going to look at:\n  - Confidence interval where we **know** the population variance\n  - Confidence interval where we **do not know** the population variance \n\n\n\n\n\n# Confidence intervals - known variance\n\n- Assuming our sample comes from a normal population, we can calculate the confidence interval for the mean of a population when the population **variance is known**. An example may be in manufacturing where we know the variance of a process.\n- The formula for the confidence interval is:\n\n$CI = \\bar{y} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$\n\nfor the 95% confidence interval, $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $Z_{\\alpha/2} = 1.96$ i.e. 2 standard errors from the mean.\n\n\n\n\n# Confidence intervals - known variance\n\n- $\\bar y$  is a random variable with a sampling distribution. \n- Because there is an infinite number of values of  $\\bar y$, there is an infinite number of intervals of the form  $CI = \\bar{y} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. \n- The probability statement says that 95% of these intervals will actually include $\\mu$ between the limits. \n- For any one interval,  $CI = \\bar{y} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$, we say that we are 95% confident that $\\mu$ lies between these limits. \n\n\n\n\n\n# Confidence intervals - known variance\n\n**Example**\n\nSay we have measured the weights of 6 chocolate bars from Florry's chocolate factory. The readings were:\n\n48   43   45   51   49   40\n\nThe mean for these six values is  $\\bar y = 46$g. Let’s assume that the bar weights follow a normal distribution and that $\\sigma = 1$g These assumptions allow us to calculate a 95% z-based confidence interval:\n\nSo the 95% CI for the current example is \n\n$CI = 46 \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$ or \n$CI = 46 \\pm 0.80$ or $CI = (45.20, 46.80)$\n\nSo we are 95% confident that the true mean weight of the chocolate bars is between 45.20 and 46.80g. \n\n- We will calculate confidence intervals with **unknown variance** in later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Confidence intervals - Unknown variance\n\n- We can also calculate a confidence interval when we do not know the population variance.\n- The formula for the confidence interval is:   \n$CI = \\bar{y} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$ \n\n- For the 95% confidence interval, $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $t_{\\alpha/2} = 2.093$ (for 20 degrees of freedom) \n- The degrees of freedom is $n-1$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqt(0.975, df = 20)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.085963\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Confidence intervals - Unknown variance\n\n- Another interesting result to contemplate can be demonstrated through the following simulation of 100 studies, each containing n = 6 observations of a fictitious toxic substance concentration ($\\mu g / l$) assumed to be $\\sim N(0.3, 0.12)$. For each sample the 95% confidence interval calculated: \n\n![Depiction of confidence intervals from each of 100 simulated samples](images/CI_sim.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Confidence intervals - Unknown variance\n\n- Approximately 95% of these simulated samples have a confidence interval that includes the true value of 0.3 ($\\mu g / l$). In the graph above, a confidence interval includes the true mean value of 0.3 if the vertical line (representing the width of the CI) crosses the horizontal line.\n- We have to accept that 5% of the time we will not capture the true mean.\n- We can widen the confidence interval to 99% so we are more confident but this can increase the chance of a type II error. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Example 2: One sample test\n\nWhat happens when the assumptions are not met?\n\n1. We can try and transform the data to make it more normal (and equal variance for later)\n2. We can use a non-parametric test (later)\n\n\n\n\n# Example 2: Data transformations \n\nMy data is not normal :( what can I do?\n  - Sometimes we can transform our data to make it more normal.\n  - Let's look at an example:\n    - Total nitrogen (TN) levels @ Wallacia in western Sydney on the Nepean River\n    - According to the ANZECC guidelines, the maximum acceptable level of TN in an lowland river is 500 $\\mu g/L$ and for an upland river = 250 $\\mu g/l$.
