Assumptions\nThe assumptions of the two-sample *t*-test include:\n\n1.  **Normality**: the data are normally distributed.\n2.  **Homogeneity of variance**: the variances of the two groups are equal.\n\n::: fragment\n### Why are these assumptions important?\n\n::: incremental\n\n- Since the *t*-test compares the means of two groups, normality ensures that the means are the *best estimate* of the population means.\n- Equal variances indicates that the two groups have similar \"noise\" influencing their means, except for the \"treatment\" effect.\n  - In the Red Bull example, this means that the range of heart rate values in students for both groups is similar, except for the effect of consuming Red Bull.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Assumption: normality\nHistogram | QQ-plot | Shapiro-Wilk test\n\n\n\n## Normality: histogram\n\n- We visually inspect the distribution of the data using histograms, generally for **each group**.\n- Look out for: symmetry, skewness, and
