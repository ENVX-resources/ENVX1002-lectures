# Importance of statistics

##

> Never leave a number all by itself. Never believe that one number on its own can be meaningful. If you are offered one number, always ask for at least one more. Something to compare it with.

-- Hans Rosling (1948-2017)

## Why learn statistics?

All of science (and industry) are increasingly data-driven and computational

::: {.fragment}
Does it matter? Statistics is everywhere and can be applied in almost any field -- a multi-disciplinary problem-solving tool.

## Benefits

Even if you don't become a data scientist, statistics will help you to:

1. **Evaluate claims critically** - isn't that important for... everyone?
2. **Communicate effectively** - statistics is NOT an exclusive language
3. **Solve real-world problems** - wouldn't it be great to understand the statistics behind the large decisions that affect our lives (e.g. budgeting, mortgage rates, etc.)?

## Lionel Messi is impossible

:::: {.columns}

> It’s not possible to shoot more efficiently from outside the penalty area than many players shoot inside it. It’s not possible to lead the world in weak-kick goals and long-range goals. It’s not possible to score on unassisted plays as well as the best players in the world score on assisted ones. It’s not possible to lead the world’s forwards both in taking on defenders and in dishing the ball to others. And it’s certainly not possible to do most of these things by insanely wide margins.

## Serious stats


### Which sepal length is longer?

*Note: common dataset used in statistics and machine learning.*


## Serious stats
### Visualise
```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
# load libraries
pacman::p_load(ggplot2, rstatix, gt)

# create boxplot
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(y = "Sepal Length (cm)", title = "Sepal Length by Species")
```

## Serious stats
### Infer - the scientific method

We use formal statistical tests to determine if differences are **statistically significant** so that we can make **inferences** about the population based on the sample data.


```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
# run ANOVA
model <- aov(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
f_stat <- summary(model)[[1]]$`F value`[1]
p_val <- summary(model)[[1]]$`Pr(>F)`[1]
rstatix::anova_summary(model) |>
  gt() |>
  opt_table_font(font = "Crimson Pro", add = FALSE) |>
  tab_options(table.font.size = px(28)) |>
  tab_caption(
    caption = "Table 1: One-way ANOVA results comparing sepal length between iris species"
  )
```


> A one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences in sepal length between species (ANOVA, F(2, 147) = `r sprintf("%.2f", f_stat)`, p < .001).

# The scientific method

##

> The man of science has learned to believe in justification, not by faith, but by verification.

-- [Thomas Huxley (1825-1895)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley)


## Science as an enterprise

- The scientific method -- fundamental to centuries of scientific progress 
- If you discover something (**or not**), it should be possible for others to verify your findings independently
- Your findings should be **reproducible** and **replicable**

## No single method

![The logical framework by Underwood (1997)](images/logical_framework.png){fig-alt="Diagram of the logical framework for scientific inquiry as described by Underwood (1997)"}

## No single method

## Key principles

1. **Ask a question** — What do you want to know?
2. **Make a prediction** — What do you think will happen?
3. **Do an experiment** — Collect data to test your prediction
4. **Analyse the data** — Look for patterns or differences
5. **Draw a conclusion** — What did you learn? Was your prediction right?


# Why R? Why statistical programming?

## Reproducibility crisis 

Despite the scientific method, many scientific findings are often based on research that cannot be repeated by others due to various issues.

From [Nature](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970) (including image sources):

> More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.

# Reproducibility and replicability

## Key definitions

- **Reproducibility**: the ability to re-run an analysis and obtain the same results
- **Replicability**: the ability to obtain the same conclusions using a *different* dataset or study population

Scientific findings should be **both** reproducible and replicable -- the tools that we use *should* facilitate this in the most efficient way possible.


## Reproducibility

How would you explain to someone how to reproduce this plot...

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
library(palmerpenguins)
boxplot(bill_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
```

in Excel? Check the [guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/create-a-box-plot-10204530-8cdf-40fe-a711-2eb9785e510f)

In SPSS? Check the [guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spss-statistics/30.0.0?topic=types-boxplots)



## In R

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-fold: false
library(palmerpenguins)
boxplot(bill_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
```



## An over-simplification

Those without programming knowledge will *still* struggle to understand and use the two lines of R code shown above.


### Learn as MUCH as you can NOW

- AI tools interface with code -- you're setting yourself up for success
- Reproducible reporting is fundamental to ALL professions (think weekly reports, presentations, etc.)
