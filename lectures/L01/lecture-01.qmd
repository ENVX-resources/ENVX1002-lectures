# Do you have a disability that impacts on your studies?

You may not think of yourself as having a ‘disability’, but the definition under the Disability Discrimination Act (1992) is broad and includes temporary or chronic medical conditions, physical or sensory disabilities, psychological conditions and learning disabilities. 

The types of disabilities we see include:

> Anxiety // Arthritis // Asthma // Autism // ADHD
Bipolar disorder // Broken bones // Cancer // Cerebral palsy // 
> Chronic fatigue syndrome // Crohn’s disease // Cystic fibrosis // Depression Diabetes // Dyslexia // Epilepsy // 
> Hearing impairment // Learning disability // Mobility impairment // Multiple sclerosis // Post-traumatic stress // 
> Schizophrenia  // Vision impairment

and much more.

In order to get assistance, students need to register with [Disability Services][disability]. It is advisable to do this as early as possible. Please contact us or review our website to find out more.

# Academic integrity

- **Academic integrity** refers to behaving honestly, ethically and responsibly in relation to all elements of your study at the university, including assessments.
- Always submit your own work, sit your own tests, and take your own examinations.
- Acknowledge any contributions in your assignment which are not your original thoughts, ideas or words.
- [Academic Honesty Education Module](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/55079) – all commencing students must complete by census date. Continuing students can self-enrol at any time.

![](images/integrity.png)




# What is academic dishonesty?

The following are some behaviours that are academically dishonest:

- **Plagiarism** (this is the most common form)
- **Collusion** or illegitimate co-operation
- **Recycling** (using your own work from previous assessments)
- **Cheating**, including **contract** cheating
  - sharing questions or accessing solutions on online "help sites"	
  - receiving coaching from a private tutoring company on how to complete an assignment
  - asking someone else to write your assignment (for payment or not) 
- **Exam cheating** (using prohibited materials, working with others)
- **Fabrication** or falsification of sources, data or results

 


# What are the consequences?

- The University has strong mechanisms for detection of potential academic dishonesty.
- Suspected breaches are reported to the faculty educational integrity team for investigation.
- The University is deeply committed to ensuring the integrity of its educational programs and treats integrity breaches seriously. As a result, the academic consequences for cheating are numerous.
- You may:
  - need to resubmit a task with a mark penalty or
  - receive a 0 for the assessment or even the unit of study
  - be suspended or even excluded from your studies for serious misconduct




# Understanding contract cheating

Commercial cheating services are **ILLEGAL** in Australia. Illegal cheating services offer to:

- Sell you essays, assignments, study notes or exams
- Ask you to upload previous work from your course
- Sit exams on your behalf

If you use cheating services, you can face disciplinary action in accordance with USYD’s policies. Resulting action can include:

- Failing the unit of study or course
- Suspension or exclusion from your studies
- Losing your professional accreditation
- Being blackmailed by cheating service operators
- For international students, losing your visa




# Be aware of illegitimate services

- Be aware of any services that are not affiliated with the University.
- In the online environment, malicious organisations masquerading as "online help sites and platforms" are preying on students. 
  - These organisations may pressure you to pay for online assistance, then turn to blackmail when you change your mind.
  - Essays or solutions bought from the internet are usually poor quality, badly written and often wrong. 
  - You won’t acquire the skills and knowledge required for your degree, making it difficult to complete further assessments.

::: {.callout-tip}
As a student, you can contact the [Office of Educational Integrity](educational.integrity@sydney.edu.au) to report something anonymously or seek advice.
:::




# Sitting proctored tests

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Exams and mid semester test will be face-to-face unless we experience circumstances that prohibit this.
- ProctorU software is used to monitor your conduct during an exam.
Incidents are flagged to the University and reviewed for breaches of academic integrity. 
- The exam will be compromised if you: 
  - Use prohibited materials (e.g., headphones, mobile phones, etc)
  - Communicate or collude with others
  - Seek help via a third party, the university’s sites or help sites
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**To ensure success, we recommend the following tips:**

1. Sit directly in front of the camera
2. Review the online test support site on Canvas 
3. Know what materials are permitted during the exam. 
4. Have your ID ready
5. Don’t wear headphones, either wired or unwired

# Topic 1 -- The importance of statistics and the scientific method

"Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations. These observations collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and experiments form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called data. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data..."

Diez, D.M., Barr, C.D. and Cetinkaya-Rundel, M., 2012. OpenIntro statistics (pp. 174-175). Boston, MA, USA:: OpenIntro. Page 8

# Scientific method

- “Scientific method refers to the body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge”.
  - Testable hypotheses; in the form of a prediction
  - The more you smoke the higher chance of lung cancer
  - Testing these with data
- [Scientific method defined in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)







# Scientific method

- Different types of science
  - Controlled experiments – classical scientific method
  - Observational studies – collecting data, abundance wildlife species
  - Modelling (empirical/mechanistic) – empirical: based on data and is a statistical model, mechanistic model is based on underlying physical principles; thermodynamics, physics
  - Model development (mechanistic) – role of stats is in model testing
  - Methodology development – different ways to measure things – role of stats is in testing different methodologies





# Scientific method

![mybaitshop - stock.adobe.com](images/AdobeStock_61795780.jpeg)





# Scientific method

- **Observation**: This is the initial stage where a phenomenon or a set of data is observed. The observations must be objective, measurable, and reproducible.

- **Question**: Based on the observations, a specific, clear, and concise question is formulated. This question should be answerable through further investigation.

- **Research**: This involves gathering information and existing knowledge about the topic. This step helps in understanding what is already known and what gaps in knowledge exist.

- **Hypothesis**: A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for the observations and question. It is a statement that can be tested through further experiments and analysis. A good hypothesis is clear, specific, and testable.







# Scientific method

- **Experimentation**: Experiments are designed to test the hypothesis. This involves manipulating one or more variables (independent variables) to observe the effect on other variables (dependent variables). Experiments should be controlled, meaning that all other variables are kept constant to ensure that only the variable of interest is affecting the outcome.

- **Data Collection**: Data is collected during the experiments. This data must be objective, measurable, and reproducible. Proper data collection is critical to ensure the validity of the experiment.

- **Analysis**: The data collected from the experiments are analyzed to determine whether they support or refute the hypothesis. Statistical methods are often used in this analysis to determine the significance of the results.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, a conclusion is drawn. If the data supports the hypothesis, it may become a theory. If the data does not support the hypothesis, the hypothesis may be revised or rejected, and new hypotheses may be formulated.






# Scientific method

- **Reporting and Publication**: The findings, along with the methodology, are shared with the scientific community through publications, presentations, or reports. This allows other scientists to review, replicate, and build upon the work.

- **Replication**: Other scientists may attempt to replicate the findings to verify the results. Replication is a key part of the scientific process as it helps to confirm the validity of the findings.

- **Theory Development**: If a hypothesis is repeatedly validated and supported by a significant body of evidence, it may contribute to the development of a scientific theory. A theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is supported by a large body of evidence.
