## About ENVX1002

::: fragment
### Learning outcomes

::: incremental
- **LO1.** Implement basic **reproducible research practices** -- including consistent data organisation, documented code, and version-controlled workflows so that statistical analyses and results can be readily replicated and validated by others.
- **LO2.** Demonstrate proficiency in **utilising R and Excel** to effectively explore and describe life science datasets.
- **LO3.** Apply parametric and non-parametric **statistical inference** methods to experimental and observational data using RStudio and effectively **interpret and communicate** the results in the context of the data.
- **LO4.** Be able to put into practice **both linear and non-linear models** to describe relationships between variables using RStudio and Excel, demonstrating creativity in developing models that effectively represent complex data patterns.
- **LO5.** Be able to articulate statistical and modelling results clearly and convincingly in both **written reports and oral presentations**, working effectively as an individual and **collaboratively** in a team, showcasing the ability to convey complex information to varied audiences.

## Resources

- [Canvas](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/71839) (of course)
- [ENVX-resources](https://github.com/ENVX-resources) -- GitHub repository for our open-source materials

## Where are the Labs?

- Lab sessions include extra time (30 minutes) for travel -- already programmed in the timetable (so clashes are avoided)

## Assessments

```{r}
# calculate this year's year number
library(lubridate)
year <- year(Sys.Date())
address <- paste0(
  "https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ENVX1002/",
  year,
  "-S1C-ND-CC"
)
```

The most up to date (and slightly more comprehensive) information for **`r year`** is [here](`r address`).
In a nutshell:
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tinytable)
library(tibble)

# Create assessment table with explicit column types
assessment_df <- tibble(
  Week = factor(c("3", "5", "8", "13", "Exam")),
  Assessment = factor(c(
    "Early Feedback Quiz (individual 5%)",
    "Project 1: Exploring data (individual 10%)",
    "Coding and data skills evaluation (individual 15%)",
    "Project 2: Modelling (10% + Peer assessment 5%)",
    "Final exam (individual 45%)"
  )),
  Description = factor(c(
    "In-person - 15 minutes",
    "Written report, 500 words",
    "In-person - 50 minutes",
    "Group presentation - 5 minutes",
    "MCQ + SAQ Questions - 2 hours"
  ))
)

# Create table with minimal styling
tt(assessment_df)
```

- **Week 3**: The **early feedback quiz** is a chance for us to gauge your understanding and provide feedback
- **Week 8**: Coding and data skills evaluation covers R data manipulation and analysis
- Final exam will NOT require you to write or interpret code -- focus on understanding concepts and interpreting results


# Software and tools

> The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.

-- *John Tukey (1915 -- 2000)*


## Baby steps...
- This unit is designed for beginners - no prior statistics or programming required
- We start with basics -- pace increases after **week 4**
- Focus on understanding *concepts* first, then tools
- We provide plenty of support -- more on this later

## Our tech stack

::: {.incremental}
1. **MS Excel** -- for data entry and basic analysis
2. **R** -- a programming language for data analysis
3. **RStudio** -- an integrated development environment (IDE) for R
4. Quarto (**Markdown**) -- a key platform for reproducible reports and documents
5. **GitHub Copilot** -- AI-powered code completion tool. *Optional, but highly recommended*
:::


## MS Excel

- **Widely used** for data entry and basic analysis
- A standard tool in many industries, including science, often to *store* data
- Can be a useful complement to R for data cleaning and simple calculations
- A stepping stone to more advanced tools?

## R

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/Rlogo.svg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
<br>
<br>
<br>

- A free, open-source programming language
- Widely used for data analysis and statistics
- **Standard tool in scientific research**
- Extensive collection of packages for data science
- Strong support for creating publication-quality graphics
- **Large, active community for help and resources**
:::
::::

## Why R?

1. **Built for beginners**
2. **Makes your work reproducible**
3. **Powerful yet accessible**

- **Importantly** -- the skills you learn are *highly* transferable to other tools and languages.
- Most easily integrated with generative AI tools -- *more on this soon*
- Well-documented and discussed online (so you can find help easily)

## RStudio


- NOT the same as R -- it's an **integrated development environment (IDE)**
- Runs R (...and Python, and SQL, and more)
- Makes it easier to write and run R code by providing a *significantly* more user-friendly interface

## Starting with R
- It's normal to feel overwhelmed at first
- We'll learn step by step
- Practice is key - a little bit each day helps
- Don't hesitate to ask questions!


## Satisfying when it works

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Click to see the code for this animation"
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load required packages
library(gapminder) # Dataset of country statistics over time
library(gganimate) # For creating animations in ggplot
library(tidyverse) # Collection of data science packages

# Create an animated plot showing how life expectancy relates to GDP
# across different continents over time
ggplot(
  gapminder,
  aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, # GDP per capita vs life expectancy
    size = pop, # Point size represents population
    colour = country
  )
) + # Each country gets its own color
  geom_point(
    alpha = 0.7, # Semi-transparent points
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) + # Hide legend for cleaner look
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + # Set min/max point sizes
  scale_x_log10() + # Log scale for GDP (wide range)
  facet_wrap(~continent) + # Separate plot for each continent
  labs(
    title = "Year: {frame_time}",
    x = "GDP per capita",
    y = "Life expectancy"
  ) +
  transition_time(year) + # Animate through years
  ease_aes("linear") # Smooth transitions
```

## Quarto

- Marjority of our resources are built using [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/) -- a markdown-based document format that **you will learn to use** in this unit
  - Lecture slides
  - Tutorials
  - Lab exercises
- Quarto  makes everything **reproducible** - what does it mean?
- Free and open source, available on the [ENVX resources](https://github.com/ENVX-resources) GitHub repository -- re-use and modify as you wish (but follow [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/))

## R, RStudio, Quarto!?

- Again, it's normal to feel overwhelmed at first
- **These technologies are complementary -- everything is implemented in RStudio**
- The **tutorials** and **labs** will guide you through the process

# Thanks!

**Tomorrow**: Lecture (1h) and then Tutorial (1h) -- see you there!
