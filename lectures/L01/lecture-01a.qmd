## ENVX1002 Learning outcomes


- **LO1.** Implement basic **reproducible research practices** -- including consistent data organisation, documented code, and version-controlled workflows so that statistical analyses and results can be readily replicated and validated by others.
- **LO2.** Demonstrate proficiency in **utilising R and Excel** to effectively explore and describe life science datasets.
- **LO3.** Apply parametric and non-parametric **statistical inference** methods to experimental and observational data using RStudio and effectively **interpret and communicate** the results in the context of the data.
- **LO4.** Be able to put into practice **both linear and non-linear models** to describe relationships between variables using RStudio and Excel, demonstrating creativity in developing models that effectively represent complex data patterns.
- **LO5.** Be able to articulate statistical and modelling results clearly and convincingly in both **written reports and oral presentations**, working effectively as an individual and **collaboratively** in a team, showcasing the ability to convey complex information to varied audiences.

## Assessments

```{r}
# calculate this year's year number
library(lubridate)
year <- year(Sys.Date())
address <- paste0(
  "https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ENVX1002/",
  year,
  "-S1C-ND-CC"
)
```

The most up to date (and slightly more comprehensive) information for **`r year`** is [here](`r address`).
In a nutshell:
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| tbl-cap: "ENVX1002 Assessments"

library(tinytable)
library(tibble)

assessment_df <- tibble(
  Week = factor(c("3", "5", "8", "13", "Exam")),
  Assessment = factor(c(
    "Early Feedback Quiz (individual 5%)",
    "Project 1: Exploring data (individual 15%)",
    "Coding and data skills evaluation (individual 15%)",
    "Project 2: Modelling (10% + Peer assessment 5%)",
    "Final exam (individual 50%)"
  )),
  Description = factor(c(
    "In-person - 15 minutes",
    "Written report, 500 words",
    "In-person - 50 minutes",
    "Group presentation - 5 minutes",
    "MCQ + SAQ Questions - 2 hours"
  ))
)

**Any questions?**

# Software and tools

<!-- > The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.

-- *John Tukey (1915 -- 2000)* -->


## Baby steps...

- This unit is designed for beginners - no prior statistics or programming required
- We start with basics -- pace increases after **week 4**
- Focus on understanding *concepts* first, then tools
- We provide plenty of support -- more on this later


## Our tech stack

1. **MS Excel** -- for data entry and basic analysis
2. **R** -- a programming language for data analysis
3. **RStudio** -- an integrated development environment (IDE) for R
4. Quarto (**Markdown**) -- a key platform for reproducible reports and documents
5. **GitHub Copilot** -- AI-powered code completion tool. *Optional*


## MS Excel

- **Widely used** for data entry and basic analysis
- Versatile and user-friendly -- most of you are already familiar with it
- Great data exploration tool

## R

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](images/Rlogo.svg)
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
<br>
<br>
<br>

- A free, open-source programming language
- Widely used for data analysis and statistics
- **Standard tool in scientific research**
- Extensive collection of packages for data science
- Strong support for creating publication-quality graphics
- **Large, active community for help and resources**
:::

## Why R?

1. **Beginner friendly (works without needing to know a lot of programming)**
2. **Makes your work reproducible**
3. **Powerful yet accessible**

- **Importantly** -- the skills you learn are *highly* transferable to other tools and languages such as Python and Java.
- Most easily integrated with generative AI tools -- *more on this soon*
- Well-documented and discussed online (so you can find help easily)

## RStudio

- NOT the same as R -- it's an **integrated development environment (IDE)**
- Runs R (...and Python, and SQL, and more)
- Makes it easier to write and run R code by providing a *significantly* more user-friendly interface
 
![](images/rstudio.png)

## Starting with R
- It's normal to feel overwhelmed at first
- We'll learn step by step
- Practice is key - a little bit each day helps
- Don't hesitate to ask questions!


## Satisfying when it works

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Click to see the code for this animation"
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-alt: "Animated scatter plot showing relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy across continents from 1952-2007"

# Load required packages
library(gapminder) # Dataset of country statistics over time
library(gganimate) # For creating animations in ggplot
library(tidyverse) # Collection of data science packages

# Create an animated plot showing how life expectancy relates to GDP
ggplot(
  gapminder,
  aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp,
    size = pop,
    colour = country
  )
) +
  geom_point(
    alpha = 0.7,
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  labs(
    title = "Year: {frame_time}",
    x = "GDP per capita (log scale)",
    y = "Life expectancy (years)",
    caption = "Data: Gapminder"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes("linear")
```

Note: we will revisit this plot in the next lecture

## Quarto

- Majority of our resources are built using [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/) -- a markdown-based document format that **you will learn to use** in this unit
  - Lecture slides
  - Tutorials
  - Lab exercises
- Quarto  makes everything **reproducible** - what does it mean?
- Free and open source, available on the [ENVX resources](https://github.com/ENVX-resources) GitHub repository -- re-use and modify as you wish (but follow [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/))

## R, RStudio, Quarto!?

- Again, it's normal to feel overwhelmed at first
- **These technologies are complementary -- everything is implemented in RStudio**
- The **tutorials** and **labs** will guide you through the process

![](images/adventuretime.gif)


# If you need help...

## Seek help early

- You are not alone, and **you need to learn to ask for help**
- We provide a LOT of support in various forms:
  - Face-to-face (in a group setting): tutorials, labs
  - Face-to-face (one-on-one): consultations -- book a time with us (email)
  - Online (collaborative): Ed for general questions
  - Online (private): use **private posts** on Ed
- From time to time, we will organise **drop-in sessions** for additional help

NOTE: **We cannot help you if you don't ask!**

# Advice from 2024 ENVX1002 students!

- "Practicals are important."
- "Ed discussion is your saviour (but check if someone has asked the same q before posting)."
- "The lab notes are really helpful for the projects - so turn up and pay attention." 
- "Start work on the assignments early so that if you need help, you can get it."
- "Complete the tutorials before the prac as it makes the prac a lot more meaningful"
- "Watch the lectures."
- "Taking step by step"
- "Keep track of the code and what it means."
- "Do not ignore the practicals and tutorials, they teach the most."
- "Don't be closed minded."
- "work with others to make notes for codes."
- "find a stats buddy in your prac to talk things over with!"
- "Ask questions, speak up if labs are moving too fast passed concepts and ask how things are relevant to out into practice."
- "The experience that teachers and demos have makes it far more relatable and helps cement an idea through inference."
- "Stick with it, focus in the pracs and all is fine."
- "Keep up with tutorial quizzes, code along with the tutorials as well as the practical, the more code you do,  the more the content sticks in your head."
- "Show up to the labs and don't rely on copilot or chat gpt."
- "Study after practicals to ensure you understand code."
- "do not panic and always ask for help, and do not stress too much over stats."


# Thanks!

**Tomorrow**: Lecture (1h) and then Tutorial (1h) -- see you there!
