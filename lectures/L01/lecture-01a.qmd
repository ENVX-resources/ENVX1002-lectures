## Campus bus

There is currently a bus that goes to Redfern Station. You can find the timetable here: [Campus Bus Timetables](https://www.sydney.edu.au/about-us/campuses/getting-to-campus/campus-bus-timetables.html)

We are looking to secure a bus service from main campus to C81, but need an idea of numbers first. 

If you are interested in catching a shuttle bus to C81, please fill out this short survey:

## Assessments

```{r}
# calculate this year's year number
library(lubridate)
year <- year(Sys.Date())
address <- paste0(
    "https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ENVX1002/",
    year,
    "-S1C-ND-CC"
)
```

The most up to date (and slightly more comprehensive) information for **`r year`** is [here](`r address`).
In a nutshell:
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tinytable)
library(tibble)

# Create assessment table with explicit column types
assessment_df <- tibble(
    Week = factor(c("3", "5", "8", "13", "Exam")),
    Assessment = factor(c(
        "Early Feedback Task (individual 5%)",
        "Describing Data Report (individual 15%)",
        "Coding and data skills evaluation (individual 15%)",
        "Group presentation: Modelling relationships in data (10% + Peer assessment 5%)",
        "Final exam (individual 50%)"
    )),
    Description = factor(c(
        "In-person - 15 minutes",
        "Written report, 500 words",
        "In-person - 50 minutes",
        "Group presentation - 15 minutes",
        "MCQ + SAQ Questions - 2 hours"
    ))
)

# Create table with minimal styling
tt(assessment_df)
```

- **Week 3**: The **early feedback task** is a chance for us to gauge your understanding and provide feedback
- **Week 8**: Coding and data skills evaluation covers R data manipulation and analysis
- **Final exam** will NOT require you to write or interpret code -- focus on understanding concepts and interpreting results


## Final exam hurdle

The final exam is a hurdle assessment for this unit. This means: 

- You must attempt the exam and achieve a minimum score of 40% to pass the unit. 

- Students who do not meet this requirement will not be able to pass the unit, regardless of their overall mark.

This hurdle can be quite daunting, but we will are here to work with you and help you succeed. 

We will provide the learning materials, guidance, and any support you need, and it is your responsibility to keep up with the content each week and ask us questions if there is something that isn't quite making sense yet. 


# Software, tools and resources

> The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.

-- *John Tukey (1915 -- 2000)*


## Baby steps...
- This unit is designed for beginners - no prior statistics or programming required
- We start with basics -- pace increases after **week 4**
- Focus on understanding *concepts* first, then tools
- We provide plenty of support -- more on this later

## Our tech stack

::: {.incremental}
1. **MS Excel** -- for data entry and basic analysis
2. **R** -- a programming language for data analysis
3. **RStudio** -- an integrated development environment (IDE) for R
4. Quarto (**Markdown**) -- a key platform for reproducible reports and documents
5. **GitHub Copilot** -- AI-powered code completion tool. *Optional, we will introduce you to this later in the semester*
:::


## MS Excel

- **Widely used** for data entry and basic analysis
- A standard tool in many industries, including science, often to *store* data
- Can be a useful complement to R for data cleaning and simple calculations
- A stepping stone to more advanced tools?

## R

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/Rlogo.svg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
<br>
<br>
<br>

- A free, open-source programming language
- Widely used for data analysis and statistics
- **Standard tool in scientific research**
- Extensive collection of packages for data science
- Strong support for creating publication-quality graphics
- **Large, active community for help and resources**
:::
::::

## Why R?

1. **Built for beginners**
2. **Makes your work reproducible**
3. **Powerful yet accessible**

- **Importantly** -- the skills you learn are *highly* transferable to other tools and languages.
- Most easily integrated with generative AI tools -- *more on this soon*
- Well-documented and discussed online (so you can find help easily)

## RStudio


- NOT the same as R -- it's an **integrated development environment (IDE)**
- Runs R (...and Python, and SQL, and more)
- Makes it easier to write and run R code by providing a *significantly* more user-friendly interface

## Starting with R
- It's normal to feel overwhelmed at first
- We'll learn step by step
- Practice is key - a little bit each day helps
- Don't hesitate to ask questions!


## Satisfying when it works

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Click to see the code for this animation"
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load required packages
library(gapminder) # Dataset of country statistics over time
library(gganimate) # For creating animations in ggplot
library(tidyverse) # Collection of data science packages

# Create an animated plot showing how life expectancy relates to GDP
# across different continents over time
ggplot(
    gapminder,
    aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, # GDP per capita vs life expectancy
        size = pop, # Point size represents population
        colour = country
    )
) + # Each country gets its own color
    geom_point(
        alpha = 0.7, # Semi-transparent points
        show.legend = FALSE
    ) + # Hide legend for cleaner look
    scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
    scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + # Set min/max point sizes
    scale_x_log10() + # Log scale for GDP (wide range)
    facet_wrap(~continent) + # Separate plot for each continent
    labs(
        title = "Year: {frame_time}",
        x = "GDP per capita",
        y = "Life expectancy"
    ) +
    transition_time(year) + # Animate through years
    ease_aes("linear") # Smooth transitions
```

## R, RStudio, Quarto!?

- Again, it's normal to feel overwhelmed at first
- **These technologies are complementary -- everything is implemented in RStudio**
- The **lectures** and **practical classes** will guide you through the process

## Textbooks

This unit does not have a required textbook, but we do draw from a range of resources, including: 

- Quinn, G. P., & Keough, M. J. (2002). *Experimental design and data analysis for biologists*. Cambridge University Press.

*There is an updated edition of this book, but we will mostly be drawing from the 2002 edition this year.* 

- Mead, R. (2017). *Statistical methods in agriculture and experimental biology* (CRC Press., Ed.; Third edition.). CRC Press, an imprint of Chapman and Hall/CRC. https://doi.org/10.1201/9780203738559

These texts are available through the library, or in Canvas via the [Reading List](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/71839/external_tools/45015?display=borderless), which can be found on the left hand navigation bar in Canvas. 

## Statbot

**Statbot** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist you with any questions you may have about coding, statistical concepts, or even provide practice exam questions.  

Access the bot here or in Canvas: [Statbot](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/71839/pages/statbot)
