# Outline – Discrete distributions

- Example
- What is a distribution
- Binomial distribution
- Poisson distribution





# Learning outcomes

At the end of this topic students should able to:

- Have a good understanding of what a distribution is
  - Definitions
  - Functions
  - Binomial and Poisson distributions
- Apply the correct model to describe data
- Demonstrate proficiency in the use of R and Excel for calculating probabilities






# Types of data

**Remember the types of data**

**Numerical**

- Continuous:  yield, weight
- Discrete:  weeds per $m^2$

**Categorical**

- Binary:  2 mutually exclusive categories 
- Ordinal:  categories ranked in order 
- Nominal:  qualitative data




# Example

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- We have 5 insects which we spray with an insecticide, each insect has a 60% chance of being killed;
- $P(K) = 0.6$
- Possible questions:
  - What is the probability that all 5 insects will be killed?
  - What is the probability that at least 3 insects will be killed?
- The data is ‘binary’ and the events are mutually exclusive (either dead or alive unless it is zombie fly);
  - we can say the data is categorical or numeric discrete 
  - we can use a binomial (discrete) distribution to "model" the data.

# What is a distribution?

- In our case we are generally referring to a distribution function
  - This is a function (or model) that describes the probability that a system will take on value or set of values {x}

- For any variable X, we describe probabilities by
  - Discrete variables: probability distribution function $P(X=x)$
  - Continuous variables: probability density function $f(x)$
  - Discrete and Continuous variables: cumulative density function 
$F(x) = P(X\le{x})$ 





# Back to our example

- We spray 5 flies with insecticide which has 60% chance of killing each insect. If $X$ is the number of flies that die, what is the distribution of $X$?
- The set of possible values is $x=0,1,2,3,4,5$
- The likelihood of each value is 
- $P(X=0)=P(\text{no insects die})=0.4× 0.4× 0.4× 0.4× 0.4=0.4^5=0.01024$ 
- $P(X=1)=P(\text{one insects die})=0.6× 0.4× 0.4× 0.4× 0.4 + 0.4× 0.6× 0.4× 0.4× 0.4 + 0.4× 0.4× 0.6× 0.4× 0.4 + 0.4× 0.4× 0.4× 0.6× 0.4 + 0.4× 0.4× 0.4× 0.4× 0.6 = 0.0768$
- $P(X=2)=P(\text{two insects die})=… \text{10 different combinations} = 0.2304$
- $P(X=3)=P(\text{three insects die})=… \text{10 different combinations} = 0.3456$
- $P(X=4)=P(\text{four insects die})=… \text{5 combinations} = 0.2592$
- $P(X=0)=P(\text{all insects die})=0.6× 0.6× 0.6× 0.6× 0.6=0.65=0.07776$




# Example plot

```{r}
x <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
p <- c(0.01024, 0.0768, 0.2304, 0.3456, 0.2592, 0.07776)
plot(x, p, type = "h")

```






# Example – properties of the distribution

- Remember we have a binomial (dead or alive) distribution here
- A key property of all (discrete) distributions is that all probabilities add to 

$\Sigma_{i=0}^5P(X=i)=0.01024+0.0768+0.2304+0.3456+0.2592+0.07776=1$

- Note that all probabilities lie between 0 and 1






# Binomial Distribution

- Why does a binomial distribution fit our insect data??
  - Basic element is a Bernoulli trial – each insect;
  - The outcome of each trial can be classified in precisely one of two mutually exclusive ways termed “success” (dead) and “failure” (alive);
    - We usually assign **$p$** to success and $q$ to failure.
  - Binomial experiments consists of n Bernouilli (independent binary) trials (i.e. 5 insects);
  - The probability of a success, denoted by p, remains constant from trial to trial. The probability of a failure, $q =1 – p$;
    - $p = 0.6$ and $q = 0.4$
  - The trials are independent; that is, the outcome of any particular trial is not affected by the outcome of any other trial;
  - The number of successes, x, is a binomial variable.
  
  
  
  
  
  
# Example
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- How many combinations are there for exactly 2 flies to die out of 5 flies?

${5\choose{2}}=\frac{5!}{2!(5−2)!}= \frac{(5×4×3×2×1)}{(2×1×3×2×1)}=10$

- What is the probability that exactly 2 flies will die?

$P(X=x)={n\choose{x}}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}={5\choose{2}}0.6^2(1-0.6)^{5-2}$

$=10×0.36×0.064=0.2304$

# Point, cumulative or interval probabilities

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- We have already calculated a point probability i.e. the probability of exactly 2 flies dying.
- But what about if we wanted to know the probability of 2 or more flies dying $P(X\ge{2})$ or between 2 and 4 flies $P(2\le{X}\le{4})$ dying??
- So how can we calculate these?
  - One way is to calculate all the point probabilities from 0-5 and add the probabilities cumulatively or in the interval

# Point, cumulative or interval probabilities

$P(X\ge{2})=(X=2)+(X=3)+(X=4)+(X=5)=0.2304+0.3456+0.2592+0.07776=0.91296$
 
- You guys try to calculate the following

$P(2\le{X}\le{4})=??$

# Cumulative

$P(X\ge{2})$

## OR

pbinom(1,5,0.6, lower.tail = FALSE)

# Mean and variance of the binomial distribution

- Mean binomial distribution 

$\mu_x=np$

$=5\times{0.6} = 3$ On average 3 flies die in 5 trials

- Variance binomial distribution

$\sigma_x^2=np(1-p)$

$=5\times{0.6}(1-0.6)=1.2$ with a variance of 1.2 flies






# Count Data

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Often we are interested in count data such as the number of events occurring in an interval;
- We generally model this data using the Poisson distribution (Described by Simeon-Denis Poisson) where we use $\lambda$ denotes the average number of events occurring in an interval

![Source: https://sharemylesson.com/teaching-resource/sesame-street-song-count-253315](images/L3_Count.png) 

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- We often write this as 

$X\sim{Po(\lambda)}$

- Where $X$ is the number of discrete and independent events in the interval
  - e.g. number of plants of a certain species along transect
  - e.g. occurrence of disease in a period of time

# Horse kick deaths in the Prussian Army

```{r}
total_kick <- frequency_kick %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n), sum_Total_Deaths = sum(Total_Deaths))

kable(total_kick)
```







# Poisson Distribution

$X\sim{Po(\lambda)}$

$P(X=x)=\frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}$ $x=0,1,2,...$ $\lambda>0$

- Note that $e$ denotes the exponential function such that
  - $e^0=1$
  - $e^-2=0.135 \text{(3 d.p.)}$
  - $e^-10=4.540\times 10^{−5} \text{(3 d.p.)}$
  
  




# Example with kick deaths

- We first identify the model
  - $X$ = the number of soldiers injured by horse kick $\sim{Po(\lambda)}$ where $\lambda$ = the average number of deaths = $196/280 = 0.7$. We can now calculate the probability of having exactly 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 deaths

- $P(X=0)=\frac{0.7^0 e^{-0.7}}{0!}=\frac{1e^{-0.7}}{1}=0.497 \text{(3 d.p.)}$
- $P(X=1)=\frac{0.7^1 e^{-0.7}}{1!}=\frac{0.7e^{-0.7}}{1}=0.348 \text{(3 d.p.)}$
- $P(X=2)=\frac{0.7^2 e^{-0.7}}{2!}=\frac{0.49e^{-0.7}}{2\times1}=0.122 \text{(3 d.p.)}$
- $P(X=3)=\frac{0.7^3 e^{-0.7}}{3!}=\frac{0.343e^{-0.7}}{3\times2\times1}=0.028 \text{(3 d.p.)}$
- $P(X=4)=\frac{0.7^4 e^{-0.7}}{4!}=\frac{0.2401e^{-0.7}}{4\times3\times2\times1}=0.005 \text{(3 d.p.)}$




# Example with kick deaths

```{r}
x <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) 
p <- c(0.497, 0.348, 0.122, 0.028, 0.005) 
plot(x, p, type = "h")
```




# Example with kick deaths

```{r}

frequency_kick1 <- kick %>%
  select(-Year) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Column", values_to = "Deaths") %>%
  count(Deaths) %>%
  arrange(Deaths) %>%
  mutate(Total_Deaths = Deaths*n) %>%
  mutate(Probability = c(0.497, 0.348, 0.122, 0.028, 0.005)) %>%
  mutate(Observed_Probability = n/280)

kable(frequency_kick1)
```

- note that observed probability is n divided by the total number of observations (280). For example, for 0 deaths there were 144 observed out of a total of 280 observations i.e. the observed probability of 0 deaths in a cavalry corps over 20 years of observations was 0.51 or 51%





# Example with kick deaths

- So now you all can calculate what the probability is, as an example, the of having less than 2 deaths across all cavalry corps for the period of 1875-1894 $P(X<2)$.


![](images/R_logo.jpg)

```{r}
ppois(1,0.7)
```

![](images/Excel_logo.jpg) - `=POISSON(1,0.7,TRUE)`








# Example with kick deaths

- Another example, is having exactly 2 deaths across all cavalry corps for the period of 1875-1894 $P(X=2)$.


![](images/R_logo.jpg)

```{r}
dpois(2,0.7)
```

![](images/Excel_logo.jpg) - `=POISSON(2,0.7,FALSE)`






# Interesting results with the binomial and Poisson distributions

- For large $n$ and small p the Binomial distribution $X\sim{Bin(n,p)}$ can be approximated by the Poisson distribution $Y\sim{Po(\lambda{=np})}$
  - The general rule is if $n>20$ and $np<5$
- We often say that the Poisson Distribution models rare events
