# The R story
- Created at University of Auckland, New Zealand in 1993
- Named after creators (Ross & Robert) -- and inspired by S programming language
- Developed rapidly in the 2000s
- Designed specifically for statistical computing and graphics, but now used in many fields

## R in today's world
- Leading tool in data science and statistics (although Python leads in majority of machine learning workflows)
- Over 22,000 [packages on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/index.html) -- extensive statistical capabilities
- Integration with other modern tools: Python, HTML, Javascript, Excel, AJAX...
- **Meets modern academic standards of reproducibility and increasingly preferred by statisticians**

## Why statistical programming?

Statistical programming **combines** statistics and computer code to:

1. **Analyse** data quickly and accurately -- especially large datasets
2. **Share** methods and results with others
3. **Automate** complex calculations and visualise results clearly

It's like having a *powerful calculator* that can help us tell stories about our data in a repeatable way.


# Key statistical concepts

## Population vs Sample

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/sample.jpeg)\
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
###

**Population**

- All possible observations
- Usually too large to measure
- Example: All trees in a forest

**Sample**

- **Subset of the population**
- What we *actually* measure
- Example: 100 trees measured in a forest

**Most (if not all) statistical analyses are based on samples, not populations.**
:::
:::



## Sampling in statistics

How well does a sample represent the population?

It depends:

- **Sample size**: Larger samples are more likely to represent the population
- **Sampling method**: Random samples are more likely to be representative
- **Population variability**: More variability means larger samples are needed

In reality, we often have to balance these factors due to time, cost, and practical constraints.

## Samples will vary

Different samples give different results -- suppose we have a population of **1000 trees** and we randomly sample 6 tree heights. If this is done 3 times, it is likely that the samples will be different:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

set.seed(258) 
population <- rnorm(1000, mean = 12, sd = 5)

# create samples
sample1 <- round(sample(population, size = 6), 1)
sample2 <- round(sample(population, size = 6), 1)
sample3 <- round(sample(population, size = 6), 1)

```{r}
# show samples
for (i in 1:3) {
   cat(sprintf("Sample %d: ", i), get(paste0("sample", i)), "\n")
}
```

So how do we make sense of these samples?

## Descriptive statistics

1. **Measures of central tendency** -- describe the "typical" value in a sample
   - mean, median, mode

2. **Measures of spread** -- describe how much the data varies
   - standard deviation, variance (commonly used)
   - range, quartiles, IQR (for unique cases)

3. **Measures of uncertainty** -- describe how confident we are in our estimates
   - standard error 
   - confidence intervals


# Measures of central tendency

mean | median | mode

## Mean -- also known as the *average*

- Add up all your numbers
- Divide by how many numbers you have

::: {.callout-note}
## Mathematical notation
- Population mean: $\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}$
- Sample mean: $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$

Where $x_i$ is each individual value, $N$ is population size, and $n$ is sample size.
:::

## Mean in R

We can save a group of numbers in a vector called `scores` in R:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Our test scores
scores <- c(80, 85, 90, 95)
```

::: fragment
Manual calculations:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true

# manual calculation
(80 + 85 + 90 + 95) / 4

# Alternative way
sum(scores) / length(scores)
```
:::

::: fragment
We can use the `mean()` function:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
mean(scores)
```
:::


## Mean in Excel

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
Excel offers several ways to calculate the mean:

1. **Using AVERAGE function**
   ```
   =AVERAGE(A1:A4)
   ```
   - Type `=AVERAGE(`
   - Select cells with your data
   - Press Enter

2. **Using AutoCalculate**
   - Select your data cells
   - Look at bottom right
   - Average shown automatically
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Median -- the middle value

The median is the middle number when your data is in order:

1. First, put your numbers in order
2. Find the middle value
3. If you have an even number of values, take the average of the two middle numbers

::: fragment
Example: House prices ($'000s): 450, 1100, 480, 460, 470, 420, 1400, 450, 470

::: fragment
Order: 450, 450, 420, 460, **470**, 470, 480, 1100, 1400
:::

::: fragment
**How is it useful?**
:::
:::

## Median in R

R does all the ordering and finding the middle for us:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# House prices
prices <- c(450, 1100, 480, 460, 470, 420, 1400, 450, 470)

# Find median
median(prices)
```

::: fragment
Comparing the mean and median:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Compare with mean
mean(prices)
```
:::

::: fragment
**Which is a better measure for house prices?**
:::

## Median in Excel


Excel provides two main ways to find the median:

1. **Using MEDIAN function**
   ```
   =MEDIAN(A1:A9)
   ```
   - Type `=MEDIAN(`
   - Select your data range
   - Press Enter

2. **Alternative method**
   - Sort your data first (use the Sort functionality in the Data tab)
   - Find middle value(s)
   - If even number of values, average the middle two



## Mode -- most frequent value

::: fragment
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in your data. It's particularly useful for:

- Categorical data (like blood types, eye colors)
- Finding the most common item in a group
- Data that has clear repeated values
:::

::: fragment
Calculating the mode can be tricky, especially if there are multiple modes or no mode at all. This is why the mode is not commonly used in statistics.
:::

::: fragment
### Questions that the mode can answer

- What is the most common blood type in a population?
- What is the most common eye color in a group of people?
:::



## Calculating the mode in R

There is no built-in function to calculate the mode, so we use the `modeest` package:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true

if(!require("modeest")) install.packages("modeest")
library(modeest)

df <- c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6)
mlv(df, method = "mfv")  # most frequent value
```

::: fragment
If you were to do it yourself, how would you do it in R? 
:::

::: fragment
::: {.panel-tabset}

## Using frequencies
Use the `table()` function to count frequencies:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
freq_table <- table(df) # Count frequencies of each value
# Find which value(s) appear most often
modes <- as.numeric(names(freq_table[freq_table == max(freq_table)]))
modes
```

## Using run-length encoding
Use run-length encoding after sorting:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
sorted_df <- sort(df) # Sort the vector first
runs <- rle(sorted_df) # Use run-length encoding to find sequences
modes <- runs$values[runs$lengths == max(runs$lengths)] # Find the value(s) with max length
modes
```

## Using loops
Loop through the vector and count occurrences:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
unique_vals <- factor(df) # Create a factor of unique values
counts <- tapply(df, unique_vals, length) # Count occurrences using tapply
modes <- as.numeric(names(counts[counts == max(counts)])) # Find which values have the maximum count
modes
```
:::
:::

::: fragment
**The point is that it doesn't matter how you calculate the mode, as long as you are able to do it.** Also -- if you needed this -- aren't you glad R has a package for it?
:::

## Mode in Excel


Excel provides several methods to find the mode:

### 1. **MODE.SNGL function** (single mode)
```
=MODE.SNGL(A1:A10)
```

- Returns most frequent value
- Returns #N/A if no repeats

### 2. **MODE.MULT function** (multiple modes)
```
=MODE.MULT(A1:A10)
```

- Returns array of modes
- Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter

# Measures of spread

## A biological example

![[Source: Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/au) # 85659279](images/seagrass.jpg){fig-align="left"}

Imagine sampling seagrass blade lengths from two different sites in a marine ecosystem, and they have the same mean length of 15.2 cm. Are both sites the same?

::: fragment
- **Site A (Protected Bay)**: 15.2, 15.0, 15.3, 15.1, 15.2 centimetres
- **Site B (Wave-exposed Coast)**: 12.0, 18.0, 14.5, 16.5, 15.0 centimetres
:::

## Comparing Different Measures

```{r}
# Plot seagrass lengths
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

seagrass_protected <- c(15.2, 15.0, 15.3, 15.1, 15.2)
seagrass_exposed <- c(12.0, 18.0, 14.5, 16.5, 15.0)

# Create plots for both sites
p1 <- ggplot() +
   geom_point(aes(x = 1:5, y = seagrass_protected), size = 3) +
   geom_hline(yintercept = mean(seagrass_protected), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
   labs(title = "Site A: Protected Bay", x = "Measurement", y = "Length (cm)") +
   ylim(10, 20)

p2 <- ggplot() +
   geom_point(aes(x = 1:5, y = seagrass_exposed), size = 3) +
   geom_hline(yintercept = mean(seagrass_exposed), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
   labs(title = "Site B: Wave-exposed Coast", x = "Measurement", y = "Length (cm)") +
   ylim(10, 20)

# Combine plots side by side
p1 + p2
```

## Why do we need measures of spread?

- Central tendency (mean, median, mode) only tells part of the story
- Spread tells us how much variation exists in our data
- Different measures of spread tell us different things:
  - **Range**: Overall spread of data
  - **IQR**: Spread of middle 50% of data
  - **Variance**: Average squared deviation from mean
  - **Standard deviation**: Average deviation in original units

## Range -- The simplest measure of spread

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Create our seagrass data
seagrass_protected <- c(15.2, 15.0, 15.3, 15.1, 15.2)  # Protected bay
seagrass_exposed <- c(12.0, 18.0, 14.5, 16.5, 15.0)    # Wave-exposed coast

# Calculate ranges
cat("Protected bay range:", diff(range(seagrass_protected)), "cm\n")
cat("Wave-exposed range:", diff(range(seagrass_exposed)), "cm\n")
```

::: {.callout-note}
The range shows us that seagrass lengths are much more variable in the wave-exposed site!
:::

## Interquartile range (IQR): The middle 50%


The IQR tells us how spread out the middle 50% of our data is:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Get quartiles for protected bay
quantile(seagrass_protected)
```

- 25% of data below Q1 (1st quartile)
- 75% of data below Q3 (3rd quartile)
- IQR = Q3 - Q1



### Why use IQR?
- Ignores extreme values
- Works with skewed data
- More stable than range


## Comparing Sites Using IQR

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Compare IQRs
pbay <- IQR(seagrass_protected)
pbay
exbay <- IQR(seagrass_exposed)
exbay
```

- Protected bay IQR: `r pbay` cm
- Wave-exposed IQR: `r exbay` cm

::: {.callout-note}
The larger IQR in the wave-exposed site shows more spread in the typical seagrass lengths
:::

## Variance: a detailed measure of spread

Variance measures how far data points are spread from their mean by:

1. Finding how far each point is from the mean
2. Squaring these distances (to handle negative values)
3. Taking the average of these squared distances


### Why use variance?

- Uses **all** data points (unlike IQR)
- Less sensitive to outliers than range
- Shows total spread in both directions


::: fragment
### Key points
- Measured in squared units (cm²)
- Larger variance = more spread
:::

## Calculating Variance in R

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
# Calculate variance for both sites
cat("Protected bay variance:", var(seagrass_protected), "cm²\n")
cat("Wave-exposed variance:", var(seagrass_exposed), "cm²\n")
```

::: {.callout-note}
The larger variance in wave-exposed site shows more spread from the mean!
:::




## Standard deviation: a more interpretable measure

Standard deviation (SD, or $\sigma$ for population, $s$ for sample) is the square root of variance:

- Tells us the "typical distance" from the mean
- Easy to understand - similar to saying "± value" after a mean
- Small SD means values cluster closely around mean
- Large SD means values are more spread out

### When and why to use it
- Values are in the **same units** as your data (unlike variance)
- Perfect for describing natural variation (height, weight, temperature)
- Used in many statistical tests
- Great for comparing different groups or datasets


## Interpreting standard deviation (with R)

We can describe our seagrass lengths using mean ± standard deviation:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Protected bay
mean_p <- mean(seagrass_protected)
sd_p <- sd(seagrass_protected)
cat("Protected bay:", round(mean_p, 1), "±", round(sd_p, 2), "cm\n")

# Wave-exposed
mean_e <- mean(seagrass_exposed)
sd_e <- sd(seagrass_exposed)
cat("Wave-exposed:", round(mean_e, 1), "±", round(sd_e, 2), "cm\n")
```

::: {.callout-tip}
The ± tells us about the typical variation around the mean. Larger values indicate more spread!
:::



## Comparing spread measures

| Measure | Protected Bay | Wave-exposed Coast | What it Tells Us |
|---------|:------------:|:-----------------:|------------------|
| Range | `r round(diff(range(seagrass_protected)), 2)` cm | `r round(diff(range(seagrass_exposed)), 2)` cm | Overall spread (sensitive to outliers) |
| IQR | `r round(IQR(seagrass_protected), 2)` cm | `r round(IQR(seagrass_exposed), 2)` cm | Middle 50% spread (ignores extremes) |
| Variance | `r round(var(seagrass_protected), 2)` cm² | `r round(var(seagrass_exposed), 2)` cm² | Average squared distance from mean |
| SD | `r round(sd(seagrass_protected), 2)` cm | `r round(sd(seagrass_exposed), 2)` cm | Average distance from mean (in original units) |

### Key Observations
- Wave-exposed site shows consistently more variation
- Each measure gives a different perspective
- Choose based on your data and goals
- Standard deviation is most commonly used in research papers


## Range and IQR in Excel

Common Excel functions for measuring spread:

1. **Range**: Use `MAX()` and `MIN()`
```
=MAX(A1:A10) - MIN(A1:A10)
```

2. **Quartiles and IQR**: Use `QUARTILE.INC()`
```
For Q1: =QUARTILE.INC(A1:A10, 1)
For Q3: =QUARTILE.INC(A1:A10, 3)
For IQR: =QUARTILE.INC(A1:A10, 3) - QUARTILE.INC(A1:A10, 1)
```

## Variance and standard deviation in Excel

Statistical functions for variance and standard deviation:

1. **Sample Variance**: Use `VAR.S()`
```
=VAR.S(A1:A10)
```

2. **Sample Standard Deviation**: Use `STDEV.S()`
```
=STDEV.S(A1:A10)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip
Use `.P` instead of `.S` for population measures:
- `VAR.P()` for population variance
- `STDEV.P()` for population standard deviation
