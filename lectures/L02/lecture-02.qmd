# Key statistical concepts

## Population vs Sample

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/sample.jpeg)\
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
###

**Population**

- All possible observations
- Usually too large to measure
- Example: All trees in a forest

**Sample**

- **Subset of the population**
- What we *actually* measure
- Example: 100 trees measured in a forest

::: {style="background-color: var(--ochre-bg-light, #f0f0f0); padding: 0.5em 1em; border-radius: 4px; margin-top: 0.5em;"}
**Most (if not all) statistical analyses are based on samples, not populations.** This is why we need descriptive statistics -- to summarise what our sample tells us.
:::
:::
:::



## Populations and their samples

| Population | Sample |
|------------|--------|
| All koalas in Australia | 150 koalas studied in NSW |
| Every fish in Sydney Harbour | 300 fish caught in specific locations |
| All soil bacteria in a forest | Bacteria from 50 soil cores |
| All cookies in a bakery | Tasting 3 cookies to judge quality |
| All students at the university | The 200 students in this course |

::: fragment
*Each sample is a small piece of a much larger picture.*
:::

## How well does a sample represent the population?

It depends:

::: incremental
- **Sample size**: Larger samples are more likely to represent the population
- **Sampling method**: Random samples are more likely to be representative
- **Population variability**: More variability means larger samples are needed
:::

::: fragment
We often balance these factors due to time, cost, and practical constraints. We will learn tools for this later -- **confidence intervals** and **hypothesis testing**.
:::

## Samples vary

Different samples give different results -- suppose we have a population of **1000 trees** and we randomly sample 6 tree heights. If this is done 3 times, it is likely that the samples will be different.

The code below demonstrates this -- focus on the results for now:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

set.seed(258) 
population <- rnorm(1000, mean = 12, sd = 5)

# create samples
sample1 <- round(sample(population, size = 6), 1)
sample2 <- round(sample(population, size = 6), 1)
sample3 <- round(sample(population, size = 6), 1)
# show samples
for (i in 1:3) {
   cat(sprintf("Sample %d: ", i), get(paste0("sample", i)), "\n")
}
```

Are the samples different? *How* different are they? This is where **descriptive statistics** come in.


## Descriptive statistics

We use **descriptive statistics** to summarise and describe data, helping us compare and contrast.

::: fragment
1. **Measures of central tendency** -- describe the "typical" value in a sample
   - mean, median, mode
:::
::: fragment
2. **Measures of spread** -- describe how much the data varies
   - standard deviation, variance (commonly used)
   - range, quartiles, IQR (for unique cases)
:::


## Data types

Before we calculate any statistics, it helps to know what kind of data we are working with.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Categorical** (qualitative)

- Data that falls into groups or categories
- Examples: blood type (A, B, AB, O), eye colour, species name
- Summarised by **counts** or **proportions**
- The **mode** is the main measure of central tendency
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Continuous** (quantitative)

- Data measured on a numeric scale
- Examples: height (cm), temperature (°C), seagrass length (cm)
- Summarised by **mean**, **median**, **standard deviation**, etc.
- Can take any value within a range
:::
:::

::: fragment
::: {style="background-color: var(--ochre-bg-light, #f0f0f0); padding: 0.5em 1em; border-radius: 4px; margin-top: 0.5em;"}
Knowing your data type helps you choose the right summary statistic. We will revisit this in more detail in Lecture 03.
:::
:::


## That is all for today!

We will continue with **measures of central tendency** and **measures of spread** in tomorrow's session.

# Tuesday's session {visibility="hidden"}

# Measures of central tendency


## Mean -- also known as the *average*

- Add up all your numbers
- Divide by how many numbers you have

::: {style="background-color: var(--ochre-bg-light, #f0f0f0); padding: 0.5em 1em; border-radius: 4px;"}
**Mathematical notation**

- Population mean: $\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}$
- Sample mean: $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$

Where $x_i$ is each individual value, $N$ is population size, and $n$ is sample size. Notice how $\mu$ (population) and $\bar{x}$ (sample) mirror the population vs sample distinction from earlier.
:::

::: fragment
Do not worry about memorising the formulas -- R handles the calculation for us. The important thing is understanding what the mean *represents*.
:::


## Mean in Excel

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
Excel offers several ways to calculate the mean:

1. **Using AVERAGE function**
   ```
   =AVERAGE(A1:A4)
   ```
   - Type `=AVERAGE(`
   - Select cells with your data
   - Press Enter

2. **Using AutoCalculate**
   - Select your data cells
   - Look at bottom right
   - Average shown automatically
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

:::
:::



## Mean in R

I'll show you how to do this in RStudio.

### Step 1: Create a vector of values

In R, we store data in **vectors** (lists of values):

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Create a vector of test scores
scores <- c(80, 85, 90, 95)

# Display the scores
scores
```

### Step 2: Calculate

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Either calculate the mean manually:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Sum divided by count
sum(scores) / length(scores)
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
Or use the `mean()` function:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# The mean() function does the work for us
mean(scores)
```
:::
::::


## Median -- the middle value

The median is the middle number when your data is in order:

1. First, put your numbers in order
2. Find the middle value
3. If you have an even number of values, take the average of the two middle numbers

::: fragment
Example: House prices ($'000s): 450, 1100, 480, 460, 470, 420, 1400, 450, 470

::: fragment
Order: 420, 450, 450, 460, **470**, 470, 480, 1100, 1400
:::

::: fragment
The median is not pulled by extreme values (like the two expensive houses at $1,100k and $1,400k), making it a better summary for skewed data.
:::
:::

## Median in Excel

Excel provides the MEDIAN function:

```
=MEDIAN(A1:A9)
```
- Type `=MEDIAN(`
- Select your data range
- Press Enter


## Median in R

R does all the ordering and finding the middle for us:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# House prices
prices <- c(450, 1100, 480, 460, 470, 420, 1400, 450, 470)

# Find median
median(prices)
```

::: fragment
Comparing the mean and median:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Compare with mean
mean(prices)
```
:::

::: fragment
**Which is a better measure for house prices?**
:::


## Mode -- most frequent value

::: fragment
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in your data. It is most useful for:

- **Categorical data** (like blood types, species names, eye colours)
- Finding the most common item in a group
:::

::: fragment
For numerical data, the mean or median is usually preferred. But the mode answers questions that other measures cannot:

- What is the most common blood type in a population?
- Which species is most frequently observed at a field site?
:::

## Mode in Excel


Excel provides several methods to find the mode but the simplest is to use the MODE function:


```
=MODE(A1:A10)
```
- Type `=MODE(`
- Select your data range
- Press Enter



## Mode in R

R does not have a built-in mode function, but there are straightforward ways to find it.

**Do it yourself** with `table()`:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Species observed at a field site
species <- c("banksia", "eucalyptus", "banksia", "acacia",
             "eucalyptus", "banksia", "grevillea", "banksia")

# Count how often each species appears
table(species)
```

::: fragment
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Find the most common species
freq_table <- table(species)
names(freq_table[freq_table == max(freq_table)])
```
:::

::: fragment
**Or use a package**:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
if(!require("modeest")) install.packages("modeest")
library(modeest)
mlv(species, method = "mfv")  # most frequent value
```
:::

::: fragment
The point is that when R does not have a built-in function, you can write your own solution or find a package that does the job.
:::



# Measures of spread

## A biological example

![[Source: Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/au) # 85659279](images/seagrass.jpg){fig-align="left"}

Imagine sampling seagrass blade lengths from two different sites in a marine ecosystem, and they have the same mean length of 15.2 cm. Are both sites the same?

::: fragment
- **Site A (Protected Bay)**: 15.2, 15.0, 15.3, 15.1, 15.2 centimetres
- **Site B (Wave-exposed Coast)**: 12.0, 18.0, 14.5, 16.5, 15.0 centimetres
:::

## Comparing Different Measures

```{r}
# Plot seagrass lengths
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

seagrass_protected <- c(15.2, 15.0, 15.3, 15.1, 15.2)
seagrass_exposed <- c(12.0, 18.0, 14.5, 16.5, 15.0)

# Create plots for both sites
p1 <- ggplot() +
   geom_point(aes(x = 1:5, y = seagrass_protected), size = 3) +
   geom_hline(yintercept = mean(seagrass_protected), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
   labs(title = "Site A: Protected Bay", x = "Measurement", y = "Length (cm)") +
   ylim(10, 20)

p2 <- ggplot() +
   geom_point(aes(x = 1:5, y = seagrass_exposed), size = 3) +
   geom_hline(yintercept = mean(seagrass_exposed), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
   labs(title = "Site B: Wave-exposed Coast", x = "Measurement", y = "Length (cm)") +
   ylim(10, 20)

# Combine plots side by side
p1 + p2
```

## Why do we need measures of spread?

- Central tendency (mean, median, mode) only tells part of the story
- Spread tells us how much variation exists in our data

::: fragment
- **Range**: Overall spread of data
:::
::: fragment
- **IQR**: Spread of middle 50% of data
:::
::: fragment
- **Variance**: Average squared deviation from mean
:::
::: fragment
- **Standard deviation**: Average deviation in original units
:::

## Range -- The simplest measure of spread

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Create our seagrass data
seagrass_protected <- c(15.2, 15.0, 15.3, 15.1, 15.2)  # Protected bay
seagrass_exposed <- c(12.0, 18.0, 14.5, 16.5, 15.0)    # Wave-exposed coast

# Calculate ranges
cat("Protected bay range:", diff(range(seagrass_protected)), "cm\n")
cat("Wave-exposed range:", diff(range(seagrass_exposed)), "cm\n")
```

::: {style="background-color: var(--ochre-bg-light, #f0f0f0); padding: 0.5em 1em; border-radius: 4px; margin-top: 0.5em;"}
The range shows us that seagrass lengths are much more variable in the wave-exposed site!
:::

## Range in Excel

Use `MAX()` and `MIN()` to calculate the range:

```
=MAX(A1:A10) - MIN(A1:A10)
```

## Interquartile range (IQR): The middle 50%


The IQR tells us how spread out the middle 50% of our data is:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Get quartiles for protected bay
quantile(seagrass_protected)
```

- 25% of data below Q1 (1st quartile)
- 75% of data below Q3 (3rd quartile)
- IQR = Q3 - Q1



### Why use IQR?
- Ignores extreme values
- Works with skewed data
- Less affected by extreme values than the range


## Comparing Sites Using IQR

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Compare IQRs
pbay <- IQR(seagrass_protected)
pbay
exbay <- IQR(seagrass_exposed)
exbay
```

- Protected bay IQR: `r pbay` cm
- Wave-exposed IQR: `r exbay` cm

::: {style="background-color: var(--ochre-bg-light, #f0f0f0); padding: 0.5em 1em; border-radius: 4px; margin-top: 0.5em;"}
The larger IQR in the wave-exposed site shows more spread in the typical seagrass lengths.
:::

## IQR in Excel

Use `QUARTILE.INC()` to find the IQR:

```
For Q1: =QUARTILE.INC(A1:A10, 1)
For Q3: =QUARTILE.INC(A1:A10, 3)
For IQR: =QUARTILE.INC(A1:A10, 3) - QUARTILE.INC(A1:A10, 1)
```

## Variance: a detailed measure of spread

Variance measures how far data points are spread from their mean by:

1. Finding how far each point is from the mean
2. Squaring these distances (to handle negative values)
3. Taking the average of these squared distances


### Why use variance?

- Uses **all** data points (unlike IQR)
- Squaring amplifies the effect of extreme values, making outliers stand out
- Shows total spread in both directions


::: fragment
### Key points
- Measured in squared units (cm²)
- Larger variance = more spread
:::

## Calculating Variance in R

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
# Calculate variance for both sites
cat("Protected bay variance:", var(seagrass_protected), "cm²\n")
cat("Wave-exposed variance:", var(seagrass_exposed), "cm²\n")
```

::: {style="background-color: var(--ochre-bg-light, #f0f0f0); padding: 0.5em 1em; border-radius: 4px; margin-top: 0.5em;"}
The larger variance in the wave-exposed site shows more spread from the mean!
:::

## Variance in Excel

Use `VAR.S()` to calculate the sample variance:

```
=VAR.S(A1:A10)
```

For now, always use `.S` (sample) in this course.




## Standard deviation: a more interpretable measure

::: fragment
Standard deviation (SD, or $\sigma$ for population, $s$ for sample) is the square root of variance:

- Tells us the "typical distance" from the mean
- Easy to understand -- similar to saying "± value" after a mean
- Small SD means values cluster closely around mean
- Larger SD values mean values are more spread out
:::

::: fragment
### When and why to use it
- Values are in the **same units** as your data (unlike variance)
- Perfect for describing natural variation (height, weight, temperature)
- Used in many statistical tests
- Great for comparing different groups or datasets
:::


## Interpreting standard deviation (with R)

We can describe our seagrass lengths using mean ± standard deviation:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true
# Protected bay
mean_p <- mean(seagrass_protected)
sd_p <- sd(seagrass_protected)
cat("Protected bay:", round(mean_p, 1), "±", round(sd_p, 2), "cm\n")

# Wave-exposed
mean_e <- mean(seagrass_exposed)
sd_e <- sd(seagrass_exposed)
cat("Wave-exposed:", round(mean_e, 1), "±", round(sd_e, 2), "cm\n")
```

::: {style="background-color: var(--ochre-bg-light, #f0f0f0); padding: 0.5em 1em; border-radius: 4px; margin-top: 0.5em;"}
The ± tells us about the typical variation around the mean. Larger SD values indicate more spread!
:::

## SD in Excel

Use `STDEV.S()` to calculate the sample standard deviation:

```
=STDEV.S(A1:A10)
```

For now, always use `.S` (sample) in this course.



## Comparing spread measures

| Measure | Protected Bay | Wave-exposed Coast | What it Tells Us |
|---------|:------------:|:-----------------:|------------------|
| Range | `r round(diff(range(seagrass_protected)), 2)` cm | `r round(diff(range(seagrass_exposed)), 2)` cm | Overall spread (sensitive to outliers) |
| IQR | `r round(IQR(seagrass_protected), 2)` cm | `r round(IQR(seagrass_exposed), 2)` cm | Middle 50% spread (ignores extremes) |
| Variance | `r round(var(seagrass_protected), 2)` cm² | `r round(var(seagrass_exposed), 2)` cm² | Average squared distance from mean |
| SD | `r round(sd(seagrass_protected), 2)` cm | `r round(sd(seagrass_exposed), 2)` cm | Average distance from mean (in original units) |

### Key Observations
- Wave-exposed site shows consistently more variation
- Each measure gives a different perspective
- Choose based on your data and goals
- Standard deviation is most commonly used in research papers
